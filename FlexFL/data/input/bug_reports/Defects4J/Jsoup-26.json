    "description": "\nTo reproduce:\n\nCreate/find a html document of a frameset.\nParse the html.\nCreate a Cleaner instance and call the clean method with the document from step 2.\nNullPointerException\n\nCause:\nIn Cleaner.clean(Document) (https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jsoup/safety/Cleaner.java#L43) the copySafeNodes is called with the document.body(). However, this is null when handling a frameset document.\nExpected:\nAn empty document or perhaps null returned. But not a nullpointerException.\n"
