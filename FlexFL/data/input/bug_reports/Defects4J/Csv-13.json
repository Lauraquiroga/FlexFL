    "description": "\n\nHello,\nUse case: I'm generating MySQL dump files (text format) - for more details check this - http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select-into.html. \nIssue: The value null is represented as \"\\N\". Also by default the escape char is '\\N'. The CsvPrinter.printAndEscape method will convert this value into \n\n\"\\\\N\"\n\nI suggest to modify the CsvPrinter in order to not escape the nullString value  - it should be written as it is. I can create a pull request if you want.\nI consider it a minor issue because it can be mitigated by making sure that the escape character is not a part of the nullString - however in my case it means that the LOAD commands should be modified accordingly.\n\n"
