    "description": "\nHi Szczepan,\nThanks for the reply, I'll simplify the methods now - do I open a new pull request, or somehow edit this one?  Sorry - I'm new to GitHub and Git!\nI haven't used a custom VerificationMode in anger yet, I'm actually writing a tutorial on Mockito and wanted to show one as an example.  The one I wrote would verify that an invocation was the first invocation on a Mock, and I had a lot of hair pulling when the .equals() of my chunk and all invocations didn't evaluate to true, even though it was the same object!\nRegards,\nHugh\n"
