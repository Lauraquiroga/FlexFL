    "description": "\nUsing 1.10.19.\nWhen using @InjectMocks on some Android TextViews, the mock is injected into the wrong field.\nWe have two fields, txtGateView & txtNextStep in a class, and our test mocks out txtNextStep, then tried to inject. This field is injected wrong, see screenshot.\n\nFrom our quick testing, the name txtNextView doesn't matter, that can be changed. But both txtGateView and txtGateLabel messed things up. If we mock out both fields, it works correctly.\nTestproject: https://github.com/SimenB/emptyandroid\nI don't know if it's because it's Android, but it was easiest for me to create a minimal test from existing code.\n"
