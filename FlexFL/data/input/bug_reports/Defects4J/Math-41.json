    "description": "\n\nThe method org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance.evaluate(double[] values, double[] weights, double mean, int begin, int length) does not work properly. Looks loke it ignores the length parameter and grabs the whole dataset.\nSimilar method in Mean class seems to work.\nI did not check other methods taking the part of the array; they may have the same problem.\nWorkaround: I had to shrink my arrays and use the method without the length.\n\n"
