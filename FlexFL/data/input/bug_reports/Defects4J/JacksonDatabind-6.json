    "description": "\nSome providers create JSON date stamps in ISO-8601 formats that cannot be parsed by the jackson-databind library. Here is a sampling of some valid formats that do not parse correctly:\n2014-10-03T18:00:00.6-05:00\n2014-10-03T18:00:00.61-05:00\n1997-07-16T19:20+01:00\n1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00\nThe last two actually come from the ISO-8601 notes on http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime.\n"
