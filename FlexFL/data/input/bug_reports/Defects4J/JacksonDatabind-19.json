    "description": "\nCurrently there is no custom handling for java.util.Properties, and although it is possible to use it (since it really is a Map under the hood), results are only good if values are already Strings.\nThe problem here is that Properties is actually declared as Map<String,Object>, probably due to backwards-compatibility constraints.\nBut Jackson should know better: perhaps by TypeFactory tweaking parameterizations a bit?\n"
