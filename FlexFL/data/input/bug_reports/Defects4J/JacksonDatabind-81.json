    "title": "Add support for handling primitive/discrepancy problem with type refinements",
    "description": "\n(note: derived from FasterXML/jackson-module-jaxb-annotations#64)\nThe problem is that although int and java.lang.Integer are related, logically, they are not related by inheritance (or implementation). Since some legacy code may try refinements in this axis it'd be nice to handle this somehow. Two basic approaches would be:\n\nJust ignore primitive/wrapper override, return original type as is\nAllow wrapper to \"refine\" primitive, return wrapper.\n\nThere is also related question of whether to allow \"int to long\" and similar refinements, but start with basics.\n"
