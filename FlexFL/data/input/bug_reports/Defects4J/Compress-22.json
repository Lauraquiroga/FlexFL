    "description": "\n\nJython includes support for decompressing bz2 files using commons compress and shares regression tests with CPython. The CPython test test_read_truncated in test_bz2.py passes under CPython but fails under Jython.\nThe BZip2CompressorInputStream is able to read 769 bytes from the truncated data rather than the 770 bytes that the CPython bz2 implementation can read.\n\n"
