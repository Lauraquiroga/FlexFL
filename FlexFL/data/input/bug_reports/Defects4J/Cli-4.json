To support special \n(well I call them special anyway) like -Dsystem.property=value we need to be\nable to examine the first character of an option.  If the first character is\nitself defined as an Option then the remainder of the token is used as the\nvalue, e.g. 'D' is the token, it is an option so 'system.property=value' is the\nargument value for that option.  This is the behaviour that we are seeing for\nyour example.  \n't' is the token, it is an options so 'arget' is the argument value.  \nI suppose a solution to this could be to have a way to specify properties for\nparsers.  In this case 'posix.special.option == true' for turning \non special options. I'll have a look into this and let you know.\nJust to keep track of this and to get you used to how we operate, can you log a\nbug in bugzilla for this.\nThanks,\n-John K\n\n"
