    "description": "\n\nI couldn't find an exact rule that causes this incorrect behavior, but I tried to reduce it to some simple scenarios to reproduce it:\nInput: A folder with certain files -> tried to archive it.\nIf the folder contains more than 7 files the incorrect behavior appears.\nScenario 1: 7 empty files\nResult: The created archive contains a single folder entry with the name of the archive (no matter which was the name of the file)\nScenario 2: 7 files, some empty, some with content\nResult: The created archive contains a folder entry with the name of the archive and a number of file entries also with the name of the archive. The number of the entries is equal to the number of non empty files.\nScenario 3: 8 empty files\nResult: 7zip Manager cannot open archive and stops working.\nScenario 4.1: 8 files: some empty, some with content, last file (alphabetically) with content\nResult: same behavior as described for Scenario 2.\nScenario 4.2: 8 files, some empty, some with content, last file empy\nResult: archive is corrupt, the following message is received: \"Cannot open file 'archivename.7z' as archive\" (7Zip Manager does not crash).\n\n"
