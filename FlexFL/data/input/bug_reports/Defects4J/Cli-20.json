    "description": "\n\nPosixParser keeps processing tokens after a non unrecognized long option when stopAtNonOption is enabled. The tokens after the unrecognized long option are burst, split around '=', etc.. instead of being kept as is.\nFor example, with the options 'a' and 'b' defined, 'b' having an argument, the following command line:\n\n--zop -abfoo\n\nis interpreted as:\n\n--zop -a -b foo\n\nbut the last token should remain unchanged.\n\n"
