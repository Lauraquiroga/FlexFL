    "description": "What steps will reproduce the problem?\nSee attached HTML file in IE6+ (does not work in IE8 unless Compatibility View is turned *on* for \r\nsome reason).\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nExpected output is on the left-hand side of the page (it is generated by the raw source). Google \r\nClosure's output is on the right-hand side of the page.\r\n\r\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nI downloaded compiler-latest.zip today (Nov. 24, 2009, ~ 12:00 PM EST)\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThere is a variable called \"threshold\" which is used to generate an array of arrays in the attached \r\nHTML file. If it is a small number, IE seems to pass arrays into the sort method (sorting an array \r\nof arrays) by value like all other browsers do. But when threshold is large enough (on my \r\nmachine that happens around 250) IE starts passing the arrays in by value. Google Closure \r\ncompiler has changed my original source from making local copies to modifying the arguments \r\nbeing passed into the sort comparator ... but as a result of this IE behavior the Closure compiled \r\ncode breaks."
