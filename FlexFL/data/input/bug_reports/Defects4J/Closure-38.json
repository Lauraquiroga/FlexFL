    "description": "What steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Compile the attached file with      java -jar build/compiler.jar --compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS --js bulletfail.js --js_output_file cc.js\r\n2. Try to run the file in a JS engine, for example           node cc.js\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\r\nThe file does not parse properly, because it contains\r\n\r\n  g--0.0\r\n\r\nThis is subtraction of a negative number, but it looks like JS engines interpret it as decrementing g, and then fail to parse the 0.0. (g- -0.0, with a space, would parse ok.)\r\n\r\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\n\r\nTrunk closure compiler on Ubuntu\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n"
