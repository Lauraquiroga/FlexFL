    "description": "\n\nIn the current version CSVFormat#withHeader is only used by CSVParser. It would be nice if CSVPrinter also supported it. Ideally, the following line of code\n\nCSVPrinter csvPrinter\n  = CSVFormat.TDF\n    .withHeader(\"x\")\n    .print(Files.newBufferedWriter(Paths.get(\"data.csv\")));\ncsvPrinter.printRecord(42);\ncsvPrinter.close();\n\n\nshould produce\n\nx\n42\n\n\nIf you're alright with the idea of automatically inserting headers, I can attach a patch.\n\n"
