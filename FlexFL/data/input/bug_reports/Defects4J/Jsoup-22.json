    "description": "\nHi,\nI have noticed that the sibling methods (nextSibling, previousSibling, siblingElements) rely on an element (underlying node) having a parent. If the node does not have a parent it throws null pointer exception.\nWould it be possible to modify the code so that it checks for parent nullness around Node.java:468?\nIn the event of nullness return null as in the javadoc?\nConfirmed in 1.6.2\n"
