    "description": "\nObjectMapper uses the StdDateFormat for date serialization. Jackson date parsing is lenient by default, so 2015-01-32 gets parsed as 2015-02-01.  Jackson\u2019s StdDateParser is matching default behavior of DateParser.\nStdDateParser wasn\u2019t really designed for extension to just enable strict date parsing.  If it were, we could just call objectMapper.setDateFormat(new StdDateFormat().setLenient(false)). But StdDateFomrat doesn't support setting lenient to false. And i.e. the reason date like 2015-01-32 gets parsed as 2015-02-01 ad Jackson date parsing is lenient by defualt.\nCan StdDateFormat can be enhanced to support to non lenient date parsing?\n"
