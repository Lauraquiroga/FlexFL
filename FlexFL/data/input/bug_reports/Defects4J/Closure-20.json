What do you see instead?\n\r\nExpected output: \"[object Object]\"\r\nActual output: \"undefined\"\r\n\r\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\n\r\nAll versions (http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/ as well).\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\r\nThe compiler optimizes String(x) calls by replacing them with x + ''. This is correct in most cases, but incorrect in corner cases like the one mentioned above."
