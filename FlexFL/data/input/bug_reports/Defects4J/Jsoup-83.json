    "description": "\nWe are using Jsoup to parse HTML documents from some external websites, which are not under our control. A few days ago, one of these sites updated their website, and introduced a bug, causing our crawling to fail spectacularly. The HTML which was broken looked a bit like this:\n<td class=\"my-cell\"\n   <div class=\"great-formatting\">100</div>\n</td>\n\nAs you can see, the TD is missing a closing >, while we did a document.select(\"div.great-formatting\"). This failed, because Jsoup couldn't parse the document correctly anymore.\nI understand it's a very edge case, and maybe very hard to fix. However, for us it was a production issue, and caused us quite a few headaches. Right now, we have a sort of preprocessor running over the HTML to close all elements which should be closed, but it would be much nicer if Jsoup would handle this out of the box.\n"
