    "description": "What steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Try to compile this: x = a % b / b * c * 2; using either simple or advanced optimizations\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n\r\nExpected: probably x=a%b/b*c*2;\r\nActual: x=2*a%b/b*c; (2 is incorrectly bumped to the beginning)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\n\r\nHappens on latest version and online. By the looks of things the change occurred somewhere between versions 20111003 and 20111114.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\r\nAs *, / and % all have the same operator precedence they should be left-to-right, but hoisting the 2 to the beginning means it's on the wrong side of the modulus operator."
