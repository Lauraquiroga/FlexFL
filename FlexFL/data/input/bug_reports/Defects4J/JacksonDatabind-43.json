    "description": "\nI'd like bit more explanation here, as well as unit test showing in what cases should this be a problem.\nDeserializers are typically never called with null tokens, as it is caller's responsibility to handle that (for root value handling it's mapper/reader, for POJO/Collection/Map properties, deserializer for that structured type)\n"
