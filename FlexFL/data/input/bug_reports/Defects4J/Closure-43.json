    "description": "What steps will reproduce the problem?\nWith advanced optimizations enabled as well as type checking (--jscomp_error=checkTypes), try to use @lends in the same way it's used on the jsdoc page at http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/wiki/TagLends - using either a utility method called \"makeClass\" or another method of class constructing such as John Resig's method at http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nExpected output is to have code compiled but instead I get a compile error such as:\r\n\r\nERROR - Variable Person.prototype not declared before @lends annotation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nLatest svn build, OS X.\r\n\r\n"
