    "description": "\n\nI am trying to feed a TarInputStream from a CipherInputStream.\nIt does not work, because IOUtils.skip() does not adhere to the contract it claims in javadoc:\n\"     * <p>This method will only skip less than the requested number of\n\nbytes if the end of the input stream has been reached.</p>\"\n\nHowever it does:\n            long skipped = input.skip(numToSkip);\n            if (skipped == 0) \n{\n                break;\n            }\n\nAnd the input stream javadoc says:\n\"     * This may result from any of a number of conditions; reaching end of file\n\nbefore <code>n</code> bytes have been skipped is only one possibility.\"\n\nIn the case of CipherInputStream, it stops at the end of each byte buffer.\nIf you check the IOUtils from colleagues at commons-io, they have considered this case in IOUtils.skip() where they use a read to skip through the stream.\nAn optimized version could combine trying to skip, then read then trying to skip again.\n\n"
