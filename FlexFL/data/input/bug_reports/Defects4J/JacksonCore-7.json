    "title": "Add a check so <code>JsonGenerator.writeString()</code> won't work if <code>writeFieldName()</code> expected.",
    "description": "\nLooks like calling writeString() (and perhaps other scalar write methods) results in writing invalid output, instead of throwing an exception. It should instead fail; in future we may want to consider allowing this as an alias, but at any rate it should not produce invalid output.\n"
