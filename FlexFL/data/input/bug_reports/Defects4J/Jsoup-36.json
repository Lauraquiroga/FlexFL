    "description": "\nWith the following HTML:\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; \" />\n</head>\n\njsoup fails to parse the page with a IllegalCharsetNameException. I see that http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" has an invalid content-type but it would be possible to still parse it correctly by using the html5  , i.e. jsoup could be more robust on this one.\nother domains which are not working but could be:\n9kuhkep.net\nwww.a-bright.org\nI use this code to parse the sites:\nJsoup.connect(url).execute()\n\n"
