    "description": "\nIt seems to me that as currently written in joda-time-2.1.jar\norg.joda.time.field.FieldUtils.safeMultiply(long val1, int scalar)\ndoesn't detect the overflow if the long val1 == Long.MIN_VALUE and the int scalar == -1.\nThe attached file demonstrates what I think is the bug and suggests a patch.\nI looked at the Joda Time bugs list in SourceForge but couldn't see anything that looked relevant: my apologies if I've missed something, or if I'm making a mistake with this bug report.\nColin Bartlett\n"
