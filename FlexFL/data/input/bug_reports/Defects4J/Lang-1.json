    "description": "\n\nNumberUtils.createLong() does not handle hex numbers, but createInteger() handles hex and octal.\nThis seems odd.\nNumberUtils.createNumber() assumes that hex numbers can only be Integer.\nAgain, why not handle bigger Hex numbers?\n==\nIt is trivial to fix createLong() - just use Long.decode() instead of valueOf().\nIt's not clear why this was not done originally - the decode() method was added to both Integer and Long in Java 1.2.\nFixing createNumber() is also fairly easy - if the hex string has more than 8 digits, use Long.\nShould we allow for leading zeros in an Integer? \nIf not, the length check is trivial.\n\n"
