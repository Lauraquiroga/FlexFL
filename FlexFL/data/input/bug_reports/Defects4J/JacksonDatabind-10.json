Haven't tried 2.5.1 but I couldn't see any related issue anyway)\nJackson ignores JsonSerialize annotation when there is JsonAnyGetter annotation.\n  @JsonSerialize(using = MySerializer.class)\n  // or\n  @JsonSerialize(converter = MyConverter.class)\n  @JsonAnyGetter\n  public Map<String, String> getParameters(){\n    return parameters;\n  }\nexcept\n@JsonSerialize(keyUsing = MyKeySerializer.class)\n(haven't tried each setting. Only tried keyUsing because I've seen a different issue (#661) with it)\nThen it works. But I need the converter, so..\nFor the time being I will use\n  @JsonAnyGetter\n  public Map<String, JsonNode> getParameters(){\n    return new MyConverter().convert(parameters);\n  }\nbut I'd prefer to stick to annotations.\n"
