    "description": "\nJson-Patch project leader has noted me that there is a bug on JsonPointer implementation and I have decided to investigate.\nBasically if you do something like JsonPointer.compile(\"/1e0\"); it throws a NumberFormatExpcetion which is not true. This is because this piece of code:\nprivate final static int _parseInt(String str)\n    {\n        final int len = str.length();\n        if (len == 0) {\n            return -1;\n        }\n        for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {\n            char c = str.charAt(i++);\n            if (c > '9' || c < '0') {\n                return -1;\n            }\n        }\n        // for now, we'll assume 32-bit indexes are fine\n        return NumberInput.parseInt(str);\n    }\nWhen they found a number it interprets the segment as integer but in reality it should be the whole expression. For this reason I think that the condition should be changed to the inverse condition  (if it doesn't found any char then it is a number.\nIf you want I can send you a PR as well.\nAlex.\n"
