    "description": "\nSteps to reproduce\n\nClone the repository at https://github.com/huxi/sulky\nExecute the contained ./gradlew or gradlew.bat\nClone the repository at https://github.com/huxi/lilith/\nChange jackson-version in the project.ext.versions map of dependencyDefinitions.gradle from '2.3.3' to '2.4.0'.\nExecute the contained ./gradlew or gradlew.bat\n\nThere will be six test-failures with 2.4.0 that won't happen with 2.3.3.\nThere are actually only 2 test-methods that fail 3 times each.\nThose methods reside at full() and nullArgument().\nI first suspected that AfterburnerModule might be the culprit but removing it from LoggingJsonDecoder/LoggingJsonEncoder didn't fix the problem.\nSorry for not narrowing down the problem further. I'll give this another look tomorrow but you may already be able to find the issue in the meantime.\nThe interesting thing is that several other test cases are working as intended...\n"
