    "description": "\nWhen deserializing a locale Jackson currently uses the underscore character as the separator rather than the dash.  Specifically, in FromStringDeserializer.java line 234:\nint ix = value.indexOf('_');\n\nMany locale implementations use dash as the separator as per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646\nGiven the RFC states that only the characters a-z A-Z and - are valid it should be possible to leave the current code in for backward-compatibility but it should also check for  '-' as a separator.\n"
