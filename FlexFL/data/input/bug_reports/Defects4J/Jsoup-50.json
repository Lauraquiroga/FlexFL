    "description": "\nThe handling of the character encoding in org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil.parseByteData(...) is bugged when the input is an UTF16 stream with unicode BOM. This method does a check for presence of a BOM and, if it finds one, incorrectly assumes that this was a UTF-8 BOM. To fix this, the code would have to check the raw BOM bytes as the distinction between the various BOMs is lost after conversion to characters. See also: http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#bom4\n"
