    "description": "\n\nWhen working on the Testcases i figured out that a deletion from an Ar Archive is not as successful as it look at first glance.\nFor example: my bla.ar file contains test1.xml and test2.xml. I delete test2.xml\nThe \"getNextEntry\" Method just delivers test1.xml. Looks correct.\nBut checking the result file at commandline brings the following:\n$> ar -t /tmp/dir26673/bla.ar\ntest1.xml\ntest2.xml\nvi shows me that there is still the test2.xml entry in the archive,\neven when getNextEntry returns null.\nDeleting test2.xml and adding test.txt afterward brings the following:\n$> ar -t /tmp/dir24825/bla.ar\ntest.txt\nar: /tmp/dir24825/bla.ar: Inappropriate file type or format\n\n"
