    "description": "\n\nNormalDistributionImpl::cumulativeProbability(double x) throws ConvergenceException\nif x deviates too much from the mean. For example, when x=+/-100, mean=0, sd=1.\nOf course the value of the CDF is hard to evaluate in these cases,\nbut effectively it should be either zero or one.\n\n"
