    "description": "What steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Compile the following program with simple or advanced optimization:\r\nconsole.log([console.log('hello, '), 'world!'][1]);\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nThe expected output would preserve side effects. It would not transform the program at all or transform it into:\r\n\r\nconsole.log((console.log(\"hello\"), \"world!\"));\r\n\r\nInstead, the program is transformed into:\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"world!\");\r\n\r\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nRevision 2022. Ubuntu 12.04.\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.\ntryFoldArrayAccess in com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants should check whether   every array element that is not going to be preserved has no side effects."
