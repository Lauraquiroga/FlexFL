    "description": "\nHaving 2 parsers concatenated with JsonParserSequence.createFlattened(parser1, parser2).\nIf the second parser is on a token that is not null and should not be skipped, the JsonParserSequence will still skip it. JsonParserSequence's nextToken() calls nextToken() on the new delegate which may cause that we miss a token.\nFor more details : forum question\nI'll open a PR for this.\nThanks.\n"
