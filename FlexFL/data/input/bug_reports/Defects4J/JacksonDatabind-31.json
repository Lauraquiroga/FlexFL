    "description": "\nHI\nI got an issue reported in my jackson-antpathfilter project that the filtering is not working correctly when it is used together with Jackson's convert feature: Antibrumm/jackson-antpathfilter#2\nDuring the investigation i found out that the cause is that the writeContext is created differently and I am wondering if this is the desired behavior or if that's a bug for you.\nIn this comment (Antibrumm/jackson-antpathfilter#2 (comment)) I print out what is found in the writeContext and I have created a TestCase to reproduce the error.\nPlease let me know what you think.\n"
