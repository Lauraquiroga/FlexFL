    "title": "Commons CLI incorrectly stripping leading and trailing quotes",
    "description": "\n\norg.apache.commons.cli.Parser.processArgs() calls Util.stripLeadingAndTrailingQuotes() for all argument values. IMHO this is incorrect and totally broken.\nIt is trivial to create a simple test for this. Output:\n    $ java -cp target/clitest.jar Clitest --balloo \"this is a \\\"test\\\"\"\n    Value of argument balloo is 'this is a \"test'.\nThe argument 'balloo' should indeed keep its trailing double quote. It is what the shell gives it, so don't try to do something clever to it.\nThe offending code was committed here:\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=129874\nand has been there for more than 6 years . Why was this committed in the first place?\nThe fix is trivial, just get rid of Util.stripLeadingAndTrailingQuotes(), and consequently avoid calling it from Parser.processArgs().\n\n"
