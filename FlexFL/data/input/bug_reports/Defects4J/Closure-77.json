    "description": "What steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. write script with string constant \"\\0\" or \"\\x00\" or \"\\u0000\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nI expected a string literal with \"\\0\" (or something like that)\r\nand instead get a string literal with three null character values.\r\n\r\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\ncompiler-20110119.zip on windows 7 x64\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\r\nThis is causing an issue with IE9 and jQuery.getScript. It causes IE9 to interpret the null character as the end of the file instead of a null character."
