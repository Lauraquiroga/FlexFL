    "description": "\n\nHi\nIf I have:\nfinal String debugOpt = \"debug\";\n\tOption debug = OptionBuilder\n\t    .withArgName(debugOpt)\n\t    .withDescription(\"turn on debugging\")\n\t    .withLongOpt(debugOpt)\n\t    .create('d');\nand then later I do:\nString dbg = commandLine.getOptionValue(debugOpt);\nthen dbg will be null. Instead, I have to use getOptionValue('d'). This seems\ncontrary to the docs (see bottom of\nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cli/usage.html), which implies that I should\nbe able to query the commandLine object using a full string, rather than just\nthe string's first character.\nCan I suggest that the API of OptionBuilder be made clearer so that it is\nobvious that you can have long and short option names---perhaps make the\ncreate() method take no arguments (thus forcing long and short arg names to be\nset explicitly). (Also, there seems to be some confusion between the terms\n'argument' and 'option' in the API, but perhaps that is just me).\nAlso, I would hop to be able to query commandLine by either a single char or an\nentire string, as suggested by the docs.\nThanks,\nChris\n\n"
