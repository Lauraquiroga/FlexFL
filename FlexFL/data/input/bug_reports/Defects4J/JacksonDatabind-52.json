    "description": "\nI think it's easier to show the code than explain the issue, so i prepared a test project:\nhttps://github.com/crew4ok/jackson-databind-test\nSo basically the issue is that the external property, by which another's property type is deduced, after deserialization is null.\nSee the failing test:\nhttps://github.com/crew4ok/jackson-databind-test/blob/master/src/test/java/jackson/ExternalIdDeserTest.java\nAm i missing something?\n"
