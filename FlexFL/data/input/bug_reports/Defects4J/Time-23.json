It should be middle europena time.\nI know that this bug has been raised before (Incorrect mapping of the MET time zone - ID: 2012274), and there is a comment stating that you won't break backward compatibility to fix this bug.\n\nI disagree that this is a backward compatibility argument\nNo matter how you look at it, it is a bug.\n\nYou could very well state that ALL bugs won't be fixed, because of backward compatibility.\nI request again that this bug be fixed.\n"
