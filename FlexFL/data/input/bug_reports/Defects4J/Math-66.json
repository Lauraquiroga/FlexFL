    "description": "\n\nI apologize for having provided a buggy implementation of Brent's optimization algorithm (class \"BrentOptimizer\" in package \"optimization.univariate\").\nThe unit tests didn't show that there was something wrong, although (from the \"changes.xml\" file) I discovered that, at the time, Luc had noticed something weird in the implementation's behaviour.\nComparing with an implementation in Python, I could figure out the fixes. I'll modify \"BrentOptimizer\" and add a test. I also propose to change the name of the unit test class from \"BrentMinimizerTest\" to \"BrentOptimizerTest\".\n\n"
