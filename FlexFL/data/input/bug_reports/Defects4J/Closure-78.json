What do you see instead?\n\r\nI expect minified code, but an error is thrown instead.\r\n\r\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\n\r\nappspot\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n\r\nDivision by zero is a perfectly sane operation in ECMAScript. See 11.5.2 [0] of the ECMAScript 5 specification. Aliased division by zero `(n=1)/0` is permitted.\r\n\r\n[0] http://es5.github.com/#x11.5.2"
