    "description": "\nhttps://github.com/benson-basis/jackson-custom-mess-tc\nHere's the situation, with Jackson 2.7.4.\nI have a TypeIdResolver that returns a JavaType for a generic type. However, something seems to be forgetting/erasing the generic, as it is failing to use the generic type param to understand the type of a field in the class.\nAll the information is in the test case, so I'm not putting any code to read here in the issue.\n"
