    "description": "\nSpecifically when I call:\nDocument doc = Jsoup.parse(xhtml, \"\", Parser.xmlParser());\n\non a xhtml document that has the following doctype:\n<!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM \"exampledtdfile.dtd\">\n\nI end up with the following result in the document (SYSTEM is now missing):\n<!DOCTYPE html \"exampledtdfile.dtd\"> \n\nBut this works fine on a document with:\n <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\"> \n\nSince SYSTEM is a proper way of declaring a DTD, I believe this is an issue with Jsoup.\n"
