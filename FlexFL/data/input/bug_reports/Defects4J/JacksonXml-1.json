    "description": "\nLooks like there is a problem, wherein nested structures like say:\n\nDefinition POJO, with records, unwrapped List with Record\nRecord POJO having property fields, another unwrapped list of Field POJOs\n\nand case where inner List happens to be empty/missing, cause incorrectly \"split\" parts of outermost Lists (here for property records).\nI will come up with a full reproduction later on, but observed this in the wild, and I think it occurs with latest 2.7.0-rc code, as well as 2.6.4-1, so is not just something that has been fixed with a later version.\n"
