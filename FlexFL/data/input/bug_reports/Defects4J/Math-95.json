    "description": "\n\nWe are using the FDistributionImpl from the commons.math project to do\nsome statistical calculations, namely receiving the upper and lower\nboundaries of a confidence interval. Everything is working fine and the\nresults are matching our reference calculations.\nHowever, the FDistribution behaves strange if a\ndenominatorDegreeOfFreedom of 2 is used, with an alpha-value of 0.95.\nThis results in an IllegalArgumentsException, stating:\nInvalid endpoint parameters:  lowerBound=0.0 initial=Infinity\nupperBound=1.7976931348623157E308\ncoming from\norg.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket\nThe problem is the 'initial' parameter to that function, wich is\nPOSITIVE_INFINITY and therefore not within the boundaries. I already\npinned down the problem to the FDistributions getInitialDomain()-method,\nwich goes like:\n        return getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom() /\n                    (getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom() - 2.0);\nObviously, in case of denominatorDegreesOfFreedom == 2, this must lead\nto a division-by-zero, resulting in POSTIVE_INFINITY. The result of this\noperation is then directly passed into the\nUnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket() - method as second argument.\n\n"
