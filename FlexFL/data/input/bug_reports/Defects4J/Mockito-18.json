    "description": "\nhttp://code.google.com/p/mockito/issues/detail?id=175\nI expect an Iterable to be mocked by default with an empty Iterable. I understand from the initial issue this behavior would be introduced in Mockito 2, but beta-8 still returns null.\nCould we return null for Iterables ?\nShould we have the same behavior for Iterator ?\nThanks\n"
