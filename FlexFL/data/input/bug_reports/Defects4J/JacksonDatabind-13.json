    "description": "\n(note: related to FasterXML/jackson-annotations#56)\nFor some use cases (one known case being use from ORM like Hibernate) it makes sense to allow use of null (or missing) Object Id, in cases where actual Id will be generated by something other than Jackson. It may also make sense to add matching DeserializationFeature which allows such a condition to either be acceptable (default), or not (throw an exception), to allow for strict checks in cases where null/missing Object Id is not a legal use case.\n"
