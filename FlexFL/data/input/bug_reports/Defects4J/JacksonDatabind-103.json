    "description": "\nLooks like due to some double-processing, certain kinds of JsonMappingException (observed with InvalidFormatException) seem to include \" at [source]\" twice. This is probably due to calls to getMessage() that add location being used to pass message property when wrapping or re-creating exceptions.\n"
