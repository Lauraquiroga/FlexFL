    "description": "\n\norg.apache.commons.math.linear.RealMatrixImpl#operate tries to create a result vector that always has the same length as the input vector. This can result in runtime exceptions if the matrix is non-square and it always yields incorrect results if the matrix is non-square. The correct behaviour would of course be to create a vector with the same length as the row dimension of the matrix.\nThus line 640 in RealMatrixImpl.java should read\ndouble[] out = new double[nRows];\ninstead of\ndouble[] out = new double[v.length];\n\n"
