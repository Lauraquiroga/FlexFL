    "description": "What steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Try the following code, in Simple mode\r\nMath.blah = function(test) { test.a = 5; };\r\nvar test = new Object();\r\nMath.blah(test); \r\n2. The output is\r\nMath.blah=function(a){a.a=5};var test={};\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nNote that Math.blah(test) was removed. It should not be. It issues a warning: JSC_USELESS_CODE: Suspicious code. This code lacks side-effects. Is there a bug? at line 4 character 9\r\n\r\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nTested on Google hosted Closure service.\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nClosure seems to be protective about Math in particular, and doesn't like people messing around with her? So, when I try the following code:-\r\nvar n = {};\r\nn.blah = function(test) { test.a = 5; };\r\nvar test = new Object();\r\nn.blah(test);\r\n\r\nIt works. When I replace n by Math, then again, Closure kicks out blah. I need that poor fellow. Please talk some sense into it."
