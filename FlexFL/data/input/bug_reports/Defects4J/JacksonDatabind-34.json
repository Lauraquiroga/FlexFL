    "title": "Regression in 2.7.0-rc2, for schema/introspection for <code>BigDecimal</code>",
    "description": "\n(found via Avro module, but surprisingly json schema module has not test to catch it)\nLooks like schema type for BigDecimal is not correctly produced, due to an error in refactoring (made to simplify introspection for simple serializers): it is seen as BigInteger (and for Avro, for example, results in long getting written).\n"
