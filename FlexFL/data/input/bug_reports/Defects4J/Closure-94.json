Create a JavaScript file with the followiing:\r\n/** @define {string} */\r\nvar CONSTANT = \"some very long string name that I want to wrap \" +\r\n               \"and so break using a + since I don't want to \" +\r\n               \"introduce a newline into the string.\"\r\n2.  Run closure-compiler on the .js file.\r\n3.  See it generate an error on the '+'.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nIt should work, since the line is assigning a constant value to the var.\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nRemoving the '+' and making the string all one line does work correctly.\r\n"
