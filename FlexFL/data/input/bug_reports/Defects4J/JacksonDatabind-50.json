    "title": "<code>@JsonIdentityInfo</code> deserialization fails with combination of forward references, <code>@JsonCreator</code>",
    "description": "\nAs a follow-up to bug #1255, the patch I provided exposes related deserialization problems.\nI have attached a small project ('jackson-test.zip') to demonstrate these issues. When run with both patches from #1255, the output is provided in the attached 'both.txt'. When run with just the first patch from #1255, the output is provided in the attached 'first.txt'.\nImportant points:\n\nWhen the object expressed as an id is contained within a collection or map (List in this example), deserialization works correctly. When it is a field of an object, deserialization is broken.\nThis particular example doesn't have forward references, but it does have cycles. Nevertheless, I have seen situations where non-cyclical forward-references also do not deserialize properly, with the same caveat as in 1.\njackson-test.zip\nboth.txt\nfirst.txt\n\n"
