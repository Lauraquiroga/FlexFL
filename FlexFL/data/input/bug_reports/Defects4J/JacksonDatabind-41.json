    "description": "\n(note: continuation of #1079)\nLooks like earlier fix was incomplete, and there is one more edge case to handle: if passed-in context is null, attempt to resolve that will fail. This should not occur since previously passing of null would simply have used \"empty\" bindings. Code needs to take care to handle this as version 2.6 did.\n"
