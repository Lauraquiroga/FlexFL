    "title": "Add new exception type <code>InputCoercionException</code> to be used for failed coercions like overflow for <code>int</code>",
    "description": "\nCurrently problems like overflow for numeric type (when JSON number value exceeds range of requested target type like int) simply use JsonParseException to indicate the problem (both at streaming and databind level).\nBut it would be better if we could use more targeted exception, to let calling application potentially handle problems differently. We can also add some metadata about type of failure, such as initial token type and expected target type.\nIt is also true that coercion failures -- where we start from valid JSON value, but fail to convert into desired target type -- are not parse (decode) problems at all, but rather mismatch problems.\nSo let's add something like InputCoercionException, which extends JsonProcessingException, but not JsonParseException.\nWith 3.x we may want to tackle other problems: for example, lack of context for \"lower level\" JsonProcessingExceptions (compared to JsonMappingException)\n"
