If no children, returns an empty list.\nBut in the case of a LeafNode, which has no children, it throws UnsupportedOperationException. This is because childNodes() calls ensureChildNodes(), which throws an exception when called on a LeafNode.\nThe result is that the calling application needs to guard against this case. But the application should not need to know if the Node it has is a LeafNode or not.\nLeafNode.childNodes() should simply return an empty list as it used to do, and as per the javadoc.\n"
