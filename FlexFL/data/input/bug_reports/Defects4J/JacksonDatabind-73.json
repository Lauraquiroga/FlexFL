    "description": "\nHey,\nI was hoping to make use of @JsonProperty(access = Access.READ_ONLY), but failed.\nAssume this class:\npublic class TestPojo\n{\n    private String firstName;\n\n    private String lastName;\n\n    @JsonProperty(access = Access.READ_ONLY)\n    public String getFullName()\n    {\n        return firstName + \" \" + lastName;\n    }\n\n    public String getFirstName()\n    {\n        return firstName;\n    }\n\n    public void setFirstName(String firstName)\n    {\n        this.firstName = firstName;\n    }\n\n    public String getLastName()\n    {\n        return lastName;\n    }\n\n    public void setLastName(String lastName)\n    {\n        this.lastName = lastName;\n    }\n}\n\nI couldn't find a way to stop the deserializer from attempting to deserialize the field \"fullName\".\nThe only thing that helps is to create a setter and annotate it with @JsonIgnore. However, that setter does not make sense and I don't want to have it. Is this a bug in behaviour or am I missing something? Thanks\n"
