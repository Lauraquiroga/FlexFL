    "title": "Fix for #1154",
    "description": "\nLooks pretty good, but would it be possible to have a unit test that would fail before fix, pass after? Would be great to have something to guard against regression.\nI may want to change the logic a little bit, however; if shape is explicitly defined as NUMBER, textual representation should not be enabled even if Locale (etc) happen to be specified: explicit shape value should have precedence. I can make that change, or you can do it, either way is fine.\nI'll also need to merge this again 2.7 branch instead of master, to get in 2.7.3.\n"
