    "description": "\nI expect the following test to pass:\nChronology chronology = GJChronology.getInstance();\n\nLocalDate start = new LocalDate(2013, 5, 31, chronology);\nLocalDate expectedEnd = new LocalDate(-1, 5, 31, chronology); // 1 BC\nassertThat(start.minusYears(2013), is(equalTo(expectedEnd)));\nassertThat(start.plus(Period.years(-2013)), is(equalTo(expectedEnd)));\n\nThe error it gives is:\norg.joda.time.IllegalFieldValueException: Value 0 for year is not supported\n\nHowever, I never provided \"0\" for the year myself. I thought it was the job of the framework to skip over non-existent year 0 for me to return 1 BC?\n"
