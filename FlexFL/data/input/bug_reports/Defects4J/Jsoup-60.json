    "description": "\nToday I tried to upgrade jsoup from 1.8.3 to 1.10.1, however, one of my unit test failed like this:\n\"div.a-row.a-spacing-medium span.a-size-base:contains(I'll Ship & Pay)\"\n\"div.a-row.a-spacing-medium span.a-size-base:contains(I'll Send & Pay)\"\n\"div.a-row.a-spacing-medium span.a-color-price:contains(Varies)\"\nAbove are 3 css selectors and in a webpage that no such element exists, Jsoup selector find 9 elements, which broke my unit test. It seems like that the contains logic broke. I'm not sure whether ' or & processing changed in newer version.\nCan you have a look at this? For your reference I've attached the html page as a zip file.\nAmazonReturn.zip\n"
