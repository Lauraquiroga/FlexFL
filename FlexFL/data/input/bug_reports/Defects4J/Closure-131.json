    "description": "What steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. use unicode characters in a property name for an object, like this:\r\nvar test={\"a\\u0004b\":\"c\"};\r\n\r\n2. compile\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nBecause unicode characters are not allowed in property names without quotes, the output should be the same as the input. However, the compiler converts the string \\u0004 to the respective unicode character, and the output is: \r\nvar test={a\u0004b:\"c\"}; // unicode character between a and b can not be displayed here\r\n\r\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nnewest current snapshot on multiple os (OSX/linux)\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below."
