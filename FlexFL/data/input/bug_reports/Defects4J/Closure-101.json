What do you see instead?\nThe file should still have its goog.provide/require tags in place.\r\nInstead they are processed.\r\n\r\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\ncurrent SVN (also tried two of the preceding binary releases with same \r\nresult)\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nFlag can't be set to false due to a missing \"else\" in the command-line \r\nparser."
