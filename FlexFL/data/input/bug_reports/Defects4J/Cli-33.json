See the following issue:\nhttp://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GROOVY-4313?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel\nCopied:\nThe following code:\ndef cli = new CliBuilder(footer: \"line1:\\n line2:\\n\")\ncli.usage()\nProduces the following output:\nline1\nline2\nNote that there are no whitespaces before \"line2\". Replacing them with \"\\t\" doesn't solve the problem either.\n\n"
