    "description": "\n\nI have found a bug in the following scenario:\nYou have an option which can take a single argument which in turn has a default\nvalue. You supply a value on the command line which is intended to override\nthis default however as the CommandLine already has a value for this Option,\nthis second value is not allowed and the command line cannot be parsed.\nI have created a patch which adds a method to WritableCommandLine and its Impl\nwhich allows you to retrieve the undefaulted values for an Option. I have then\nchanged ArgumentImpl to use this method to determine the argument count\n\n"
