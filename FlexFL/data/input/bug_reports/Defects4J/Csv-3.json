    "description": "\n\nThe current escape parsing converts <esc><char> to plain <char> if the <char> is not one of the special characters to be escaped.\nThis can affect unicode escapes if the <esc> character is backslash.\nOne way round this is to specifically check for <char> == 'u', but it seems wrong to only do this for 'u'.\nAnother solution would be to leave <esc><char> as is unless the <char> is one of the special characters.\nThere are several possible ways to treat unrecognised escapes:\n\ntreat it as if the escape char had not been present (current behaviour)\nleave the escape char as is\nthrow an exception\n\n\n"
