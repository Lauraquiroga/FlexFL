    "description": "\n\nExtendedBufferReader checks for '\\n' (LF) in the read() methods, incrementing linecount when found.\nHowever, the readLine() method calls BufferedReader.readLine() which treats CR, LF and CRLF equally (and drops them).\nIf the code is to be flexible in what it accepts, the class should also allow for CR alone as a line terminator.\nIt should work if the code increments the line counter for CR, and for LF if the previous character was not CR.\n\n"
